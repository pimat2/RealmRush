# RealmRush
## A 3D Tower Defense Game from the Fourth Section of the 3D Game Development in Unity Course from GameDevTV
The main difference between this branch of the repository and the main one is that in this one the enemies that get instantiated use a BreadthFirstSearch Pathfinding Algorithm 
to travel to their end destination. This in turn enables the player to create structures almost anywhere on the level(with the exception that he/she cannot block the path towards the end goal of the enemies).
The path that enemies follow also updates during gameplay so enemies adjust their route in accordance to the position of the structures that the player builds
