## A 3D Tower Defense Game from the Fourth Section of the 3D Game Development in Unity Course from GameDevTV
In this section of the C# Unity Game Developer 3D Course I created a simple tower defense game in which the player has to defend his castle from the upcoming enemies.
In this version (main branch) of the game the enemies that get instantiated follow a predefined path using a list of waypoints. 
In addition the player can instantiate structures on mouse click at certain positions in the level. 
These structures act as the towers that should destroy the enemies which award the player with gold that he/she can use to create more structures.
